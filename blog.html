                This is my first code blog entry. I did not encounter any major challenges for this first assignment
                since many of the techniques used were demonstrated in class. The greatest difficulty came from formatting the 
                document properly and this was accomplished by playing with the options available and checking my work frequently.
                Before this assignment I did not know anything about HTML so everything I have demonstrated in this assingment was
                recently learned. This included how to insert hyperlinks and images, how to create paragraphs, how to create headers, 
                and how to publish the document. To complete this assignment I rewatched the recorded class video from 04/04/22 where
                many of these techniques were demonstrated. I also checked on Campuswire to see common pitfall other students had run
                into. I had previously used Github for other classes so managing the code was not a difficult process.
